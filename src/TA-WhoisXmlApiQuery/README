       --------
       First release.

A custom command that adds whois data from WhoisXMLAPI.

How it works:
This Splunk App provides a custom command that takes the domain from one or more events and uses the WhoisXMLAPI API to populate whois information for each domain.

Before first use, configure the API key using the app's setup page.

Simply define which splunk field is your domain from the extracted data, and call it domain and then pass that to the whoisxmlapi command

| eval domain=source_dom | whoisxmlapi
